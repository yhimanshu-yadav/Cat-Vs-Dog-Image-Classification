# Cat-Vs-Dog-Image-Classification
This project uses kereas, CV2, tensorflow, matplotlib. 
Firstly, I have used the API token of the kaggle and then pasted to the workspace drive. This enables not to manually load the dataset to the colab rather it directly imports the data from the kaggle cloud to the goocle colab cloud.
